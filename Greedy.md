# <center>**Greedy**
<br>

These algorithms are based on the apprach that the current solutions is the best solution. It might not be the correct answer.<br>
It works in top-down approach. It goes for local best choise to produce global best result.
<br>

Greedy algo is used when problems have:
- **Greedy choice property**: If optimum solution can be found by choosing the best choice at each step.
- **Optimal substructure**: If overall optimal solutions of problem corresponds to optimal solution in each subproblem.

### Advantages:
- easy to describe
- performs better (in most cases)

### Drawbacks:
- Doesn't always produces an optimal solution

### Approach:
- Start with an empty set containing solution
- At each step, an item is added in the solution set
- If solution set is feasible, the current solution is kept else discarded and not considered again.

### Types:
- Selection Sort
- Knapsack Problem
- Minimum Spanning Tree
- Single source shortest path problem
- Job scheduling problem
- Prim's
- Krushkal's
- Dijkstra's
- Huffman's
- Ford-Fulkerson's
