# <center>**Trees**
<br>

## **Tree Data Structure:**
Non hierarchial data structure that consists of nodes and edges.<br>
##### **WHY?**:<br>
- Other datastructure are linear, operations time complexity increases with size.<br>
- Tree is non-linear, allows quicker and easire access to data.
<br>

### Terminologies:
- **Node**: 
    - Entity that contains value and pointer to child nodes.
    - Last node of each path is called Leaf Node or external node. They do not have pointer to child.
    - Node having atleast one pointer to child node is called internal node.
- **Edge**: Link between two nodes.
- **Root**: Topmost element of the tree.
- **Height of the node**: Longest path from node to leaf node.
- **Depth of the node**: Number of edges from root to node.
- **Height of tree**: Longest path from root to leaf node (Height of root node).
- **Degree of node**: Number of branches of the node.
- **Forest**: Collection of disjoint trees.
<br>

### Types:
- Binary Tree
- Binary Search Tree
- Avial Tree
- B- Tree
<br>

### Applications:
- BST used to check if an element is present.
- Heaps used in heap sort.
- Tries used in routers to store routing information.
- Databases use B- and T- trees.
- Compilers use syntax trees to validate synatx of programs.
